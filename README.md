# Ransomware
I have created one ransomware which is not working it just a example of how ransomware are worked how they encrypted our file and demand for some ransom.
Just you have to copy the .VBA file to your notepad and save that file with the extension .vba 
After somebody opens that file boom it will show you the msg you r locked and your files are encrypted and you have to enter the password to decrypt that 
so you have to enter password which is "winteriscomming" and then you openn that file ...
It is just for educational purpose it does not originally locked your file it just a example of how ransomware works...
